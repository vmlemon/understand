Many of the formatting commands use the 
system's locale settings for the date and time, for example the characters 
used to separate components of the date and time and the ordering of day, 
month and year. The list of formatting commands below is divided into two 
sections, the first of which lists the commands which operate without reference 
to the locale's date and time settings (see class TLocale) and the second 
table lists the commands which do use these settings.

The following formatting commands do not honour the locale-specific system 
settings:

\%\% : Include a single '%' character in the string

\%* : Abbreviate following item (the following item should not be preceded 
by a '%' character).

\%C : Interpret the argument as the six digit microsecond component of the 
time. In its abbreviated form, ('%*C') this should be followed by an integer 
between zero and six, where the integer indicates the number of digits to display.

\%D : Interpret the argument as the two digit day number in the month. Abbreviation 
suppresses leading zero.

\%E : Interpret the argument as the day name. Abbreviation is language-specific 
(e.g. English uses the first three letters).

\%F : Use this command for locale-independent ordering of date components. 
This orders the following day/month/year component(s) (\%D, \%M, \%Y for example) 
according to the order in which they are specified in the string. This removes 
the need to use \%1 to \%5 (described below).

\%H : Interpret the argument as the one or two digit hour component of the 
time in 24 hour time format. Abbreviation suppresses leading zero. For locale-dependent 
hour formatting, use \%J.

\%I : Interpret the argument as the one or two digit hour component of the 
time in 12 hour time format. The leading zero is automatically suppressed 
so that abbreviation has no effect. For locale-dependent hour formatting, 
use \%J.

\%M : Interpret the argument as the one or two digit month number. Abbreviation 
suppresses leading zero.

\%N : Interpret the argument as the month name. Abbreviation is language specific, e.g. 
English uses the first three letters only. When using locale-dependent formatting, 
(that is, \%F has not previously been specified), specifying \%N causes any 
subsequent occurrence of a month specifier in the string to insert the month 
as text rather than in numeric form. When using locale-independent formatting, 
specifying \%N causes the month to be inserted as text at that position, but 
any subsequent occurrence of \%M will cause the month to be inserted in numeric 
form.

\%S : Interpret the argument as the one or two digit seconds component of the 
time. Abbreviation suppresses leading zero.

\%T : Interpret the argument as the one or two digit minutes component of the 
time. Abbreviation suppresses leading zero.

\%W : Interpret the argument as the one or two digit week number in year. Abbreviation 
suppresses leading zero.

\%X : Interpret the argument as the date suffix. Cannot be abbreviated. When 
using locale-dependent formatting (that is, \%F has not previously been specified), 
\%X causes all further occurrences of the day number to be displayed with the 
date suffix. When using locale-independent formatting, a date suffix will 
be inserted only after the occurrence of the day number which \%X follows in 
the format string. Any further occurrence of \%D without a following \%X will 
insert the day number without a suffix.

\%Y : Interpret the argument as the four digit year number. Abbreviation suppresses 
the first two digits.

\%Z : Interpret the argument as the one, two or three digit day number in the 
year. Abbreviation suppresses leading zeros.

The following formatting commands do honour the locale-specific system settings:

\%. : Interpret the argument as the decimal separator character (as set by 
TLocale::SetDecimalSeparator()). The decimal separator is used to separate 
seconds and microseconds, if present.

\%: : Interpret the argument as one of the four time separator characters (as 
set by TLocale::SetTimeSeparator()). Must be followed by an integer between 
zero and three inclusive to indicate which time separator character is being 
referred to.

\%/ : Interpret the argument as one of the four date separator characters (as 
set by TLocale::SetDateSeparator()). Must be followed by an integer between 
zero and three inclusive to indicate which date separator character is being 
referred to.

\%1 : Interpret the argument as the first component of a three component date 
(i.e. day, month or year) where the order has been set by TLocale::SetDateFormat(). 
When the date format is EDateEuropean, this is the day, when EDateAmerican, 
the month, and when EDateJapanese, the year. For more information on this 
and the following four formatting commands, see the Notes section immediately 
below.

\%2 : Interpret the argument as the second component of a three component date 
where the order has been set by TLocale::SetDateFormat(). When the date format 
is EDateEuropean, this is the month, when EDateAmerican, the day and when 
EDateJapanese, the month.

\%3 : Interpret the argument as the third component of a three component date 
where the order has been set by TLocale::SetDateFormat(). When the date format 
is EDateEuropean, or EDateAmerican this is the year and when EDateJapanese, 
the day.

\%4 : Interpret the argument as the first component of a two component date 
(day and month) where the order has been set by TLocale::SetDateFormat(). 
When the date format is EDateEuropean this is the day, and when EDateAmerican 
or EDateJapanese, the month.

\%5 : Interpret the argument as the second component of a two component date 
(day and month) where the order has been set by TLocale::SetDateFormat(). 
When the date format is EDateEuropean this is the month, and when EDateAmerican 
or EDateJapanese, the day.

\%A : Interpret the argument as "am" or "pm" text according to the current 
language and time of day. Unlike the \%B formatting command (described below), 
\%A disregards the locale's 12 or 24 hour clock setting, so that when used 
without an inserted + or - sign, am/pm text will always be displayed. Whether 
a space is inserted between the am/pm text and the time depends on the locale-specific 
settings. However, if abbreviated (\%*A), no space is inserted, regardless 
of the locale's settings. The am/pm text appears before or after the time, 
according to the position of the \%A, regardless of the locale-specific settings. 
For example, the following ordering of formatting commands causes am/pm text 
to be printed after the time: \%H \%T \%S \%A. Optionally, a minus or plus sign 
may be inserted between the "%" and the "A". This operates as follows:

\%-A causes am/pm text to be inserted into the descriptor only if the am/pm 
symbol position has been set in the locale to ELocaleBefore. Cannot be abbreviated 
using asterisk.

\%+A causes am/pm text to be inserted into the descriptor only if the am/pm 
symbol position has been set in the locale to ELocaleAfter. Cannot be abbreviated 
using asterisk. For example, the following formatting commands will cause 
am/pm text to be displayed after the time if the am/pm position has been set 
in the locale to ELocaleAfter or before the time if ELocaleBefore: \%-A \%H 
\%T \%S \%+A.

\%B Interpret the argument as am or pm text according to the current language 
and time of day. Unlike the \%A command, when using \%B, am/pm text is displayed 
only if the clock setting in the locale is 12-hour. Whether a space is inserted 
between the am/pm text and the time depends on the locale-specific settings. 
However, if abbreviated (\%*B), no space is inserted, regardless of the locale's 
settings. The am/pm text appears before or after the time, according to the 
location of the "%B", regardless of the locale-specific settings. For example, 
the following formatting commands cause am/pm text to be printed after the 
time: \%H \%T \%S \%B. Optionally, a minus or plus sign may be inserted between 
the "%" and the "B". This operates as follows:

\%-B causes am/pm text to be inserted into the descriptor only if using a 12 
hour clock and the am/pm symbol position has been set in the locale to ELocaleBefore. 
Cannot be abbreviated using asterisk.

\%+B causes am/pm text to be inserted into the descriptor only if using a 12 
hour clock and the am/pm symbol position has been set in the locale to ELocaleAfter. 
Cannot be abbreviated using asterisk. For example, the following formatting 
commands cause am/pm text to be printed after the time if the am/pm position 
has been set in the locale to ELocaleAfter or before the time if ELocaleBefore: 
\%-B \%H \%T \%S \%+B.

\%J Interpret the argument as the hour component of the time in either 12 or 
24 hour clock format depending on the locale's clock format setting. When 
the clock format has been set to 12 hour, leading zeros are automatically 
suppressed so that abbreviation has no effect. Abbreviation suppresses leading 
zero only when using a 24 hour clock.

Notes:

The \%1, \%2, \%3, \%4 and \%5 formatting commands are used in conjunction with 
\%D, \%M and \%Y to format the date locale-dependently. When formatting the date 
locale-dependently, the order of the day, month and year components within 
the string is determined by the order of the \%1 to \%5 formatting commands, 
not that of \%D, \%M, \%Y.

When formatting the date locale-independently (that is, \%F has been specified 
in the format string), the \%1 to \%5 formatting commands are not required, 
and should be omitted. In this case, the order of the date components is determined 
by the order of the \%D, \%M, \%Y format commands within aFormat.

Up to four date separators and up to four time separators can be used to separate 
the components of a date or time. When formatting a numerical date consisting 
of the day, month and year or a time containing hours, minutes and seconds, 
all four separators should always be specified in the format command string. 
Usually, the leading and trailing separators should not be displayed. In this 
case, the first and fourth separators should still be specified, but should 
be represented by a null character.

The date format follows the pattern:

DateSeparator[0] DateComponent1 DateSeparator[1] DateComponent2 DateSeparator[2] 
DateComponent3 DateSeparator[3]

where the ordering of date components is determined by the locale's date format 
setting.

The time format follows the pattern:

TimeSeparator[0] Hours TimeSeparator[1] Minutes TimeSeparator[2] Seconds TimeSeparator[3]

If the time includes a microseconds component, the third separator should 
occur after the microseconds, and the seconds and microseconds should be separated 
by the decimal separator. When formatting a two component time, the following 
rules apply:

if the time consists of hours and minutes, the third time delimiter should 
be omitted 

if the time consists of minutes and seconds, the second time delimiter should 
be omitted

@param aDes    Descriptor, which,  on return contains the formatted date/time string.
